# tidal-looper
Different looper variants for SuperDirt to provide live sampling in TidalCycles.

To get started, you should first look at the Looper in Replace mode (see https://github.com/thgrund/tidal-looper/tree/master/replace).

## Looper types

Currently the following Looper types exist:

| Type          | URL                                                          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| With feedback | https://github.com/thgrund/tidal-looper/tree/master/feedback | To display the recording status, osc messages are sent via SuperCollider. This folder contains an example for Hydra and an example for CycSeq. |
| Overdub       | https://github.com/thgrund/tidal-looper/tree/master/overdub  | Simulates an overdub mode. You can play all samples on a sample bank with the playAll function, but you can use each sample with the n function too. |
| Replace       | https://github.com/thgrund/tidal-looper/tree/master/replace  | Simulates an replace mode. Basically you have to specify each sample name on for recording and playback on your own. |
